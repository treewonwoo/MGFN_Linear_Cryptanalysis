# MGFN-18R Linear Cryptanalysis and Master-Key Recovery

This repository provides a full C implementation for linear cryptanalysis and 128-bit master-key recovery on a reduced 18-round version of a block cipher called MGFN-18R.

The code performs:
- Key schedule and encryption of MGFN-18R
- Dataset generation for known (plaintext, ciphertext) pairs
- 3-round linear cryptanalysis
- Recovery of the final 3 round keys: rk16 ^ K10_R, rk17 ^ K10_L, rk18 ^ K10_R
- Exhaustive search over 2^35 master-key candidates to find the correct 128-bit key

---

## 🔧 Features

- 3-round nibble-by-nibble round-key recovery (R16–R18 xor K10_*)
- 2^35 candidate search using only 2 known (P, C) pairs
- Full 128-bit key reconstruction from partially recovered round keys
- Highly parallelized with OpenMP
- Scalable dataset size: adjustable up to 2^33 (P, C) pairs

## ⚙️ Build (Visual Studio)

### Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- OpenMP enabled (via `/openmp`)
- C11 or later language standard

### How to configure:

1. Open or create a project named `MGFN_18R_LC_CODE`
2. Add the 4 `.c` and 2 `.h` files to the project
3. Enable OpenMP:
   Project → Properties → C/C++ → Language → OpenMP Support → Yes
4. Set language standard:
   Project → Properties → C/C++ → Language → C Language Standard → ISO C11
5. Build and run (Ctrl + F5)

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the executable to start full recovery flow:

```bash
MGFN_18R_LC.exe
```

This will:
1. Generate `N` plaintext-ciphertext pairs using a random 128-bit master key
2. Perform 3-round linear cryptanalysis
3. Recover 32-bit round keys:
   - rk16 ⊕ K10_R
   - rk17 ⊕ K10_L
   - rk18 ⊕ K10_R
4. Search among 2^35 possible master keys using 2 known (P, C) pairs
5. Output recovered key and verification result

> 💡 **Note:**  
> Dataset size and file paths are defined in `MGFN_18R_LC.c`.  
> You can adjust:
> - `#define TARGET_PAIRS ((uint64_t)1ULL << N)` for dataset size  
> - `const char* DATA_BIN = "..."`, `LOG_FILE = "..."` for file paths

---

## 📂 Output

- Ciphertext dataset (binary):  
  `./pt_ct_tmp.bin`

- Recovered round keys and master key log:  
  `./keys.txt`

## 📄 Key API

```c
int find_master_key(
    const Pair      pairs[2],
    uint32_t        rk16_xor_K10_R,  // 32-bit key: rk16 ^ K10_R
    uint32_t        rk17_xor_K10_L,  // 32-bit key: rk17 ^ K10_L
    uint32_t        rk18_xor_K10_R,  // 32-bit key: rk18 ^ K10_R
    uint8_t         master_key_out[16]
);
```

This function performs an exhaustive search over 2^35 candidate keys  
using the given 2 (P, C) pairs and the recovered round keys.
